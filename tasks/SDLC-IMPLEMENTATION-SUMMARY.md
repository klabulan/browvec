### 2. âœ… Restructured Task Management System
**New Directory Structure**:
```
/tasks/
â”œâ”€â”€ current_stage/              # Active sprint management
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README.md              # Sprint overview with agent workflow
â”œâ”€â”€ TASK-001-export-import/    # âœ… COMPLETED - Individual task directories
â”œâ”€â”€ TASK-002-demo-completion/  # âœ… COMPLETED
â”œâ”€â”€ TASK-003-multi-collections/ # Ready for next sprint
â”œâ”€â”€ templates/                 # Standardized templates
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.md        # Business and technical requirements
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ design.md             # Technical architecture template
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ breakdown.md          # Detailed work breakdown template
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ progress.md           # Progress tracking template
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ testing.md            # Testing strategy template
â””â”€â”€ initial_stage/            # Historical MVP tasks
```

### 3. âœ… Agent Role Model Implementation
**Defined 5 Specialized Agents**:

| Agent | Status | Purpose | Capabilities |
|-------|--------|---------|--------------|
| **Task Management Agent** | ðŸ”´ MISSING | Project workflow oversight | Sprint planning, progress tracking, risk management |
| **System Architect Agent** | âœ… AVAILABLE | Technical architecture | Design decisions, BDD analysis, performance optimization |
| **Coding Agent** | âœ… AVAILABLE | Implementation | Step-by-step development, testing, integration |
| **QA Agent** | ðŸ”´ MISSING | Quality assurance | Code review, testing strategy, compatibility |
| **Documentation Agent** | ðŸ”´ MISSING | Technical documentation | API docs, user guides, examples |

**Enhanced Existing Agents**:
- **universal-dev-architect**: Added LocalRetrieve-specific expertise requirements
- **polyglot-architect-developer**: Enhanced with sqlite-vec and Worker optimization needs

### 4. âœ… Project Status Update
**MVP Completion**: Updated from 67% to **100% Complete**
- âœ… Export/Import functionality - Fully implemented
- âœ… Demo application - Production ready
- âœ… All 12 MVP tickets completed
- âœ… Professional SDLC processes established

### 5. âœ… Documentation Updates
**README.md Enhancements**:
- Updated project status to 100% MVP complete
- Added development process section with agent-driven workflow
- Documented task management structure
- Added branching strategy and quality standards

**CLAUDE.md Transformation**:
- Complete rewrite with professional SDLC practices
- Agent role model with TypeScript interfaces
- Quality gates and review processes
- Task workflow integration

## Implementation Details

### Task Directory Structure
Each task now has its own directory with standardized artifacts:
- **requirements.md**: BDD-style requirements with acceptance criteria
- **design.md**: Technical architecture with component diagrams
- **breakdown.md**: Detailed work breakdown with phases and quality gates
- **progress.md**: Real-time progress tracking with daily logs
- **testing.md**: Comprehensive testing strategy and test cases

### Agent Workflow Integration

sequenceDiagram
    participant TM as Task Management Agent
    participant SA as System Architect Agent
    participant CA as Coding Agent
    participant QA as QA Agent
    participant DA as Documentation Agent

    TM->>SA: Create task requirements
    SA->>SA: Design technical solution
    SA->>CA: Provide implementation plan
    CA->>CA: Implement features
    CA->>QA: Request code review
    QA->>QA: Test and validate
    QA->>DA: Update documentation
    DA->>TM: Complete task delivery
```

### Quality Standards
- TypeScript strict mode mandatory
- Minimum 1 reviewer for changes
- All PRs must pass CI/CD checks
- Demo must work after every merge
- Documentation updated for API changes

## Strategic Impact
