    checkout main
    merge feature/TASK-002-demo-completion
    commit id: "MVP v0.2.0 Release"
```

### Task Workflow Integration

1. **Requirements Analysis**
   - Study `/doc/vision.md` for product context
   - Review `/doc/target_architecture.md` for technical constraints
   - Create detailed ticket in `/tasks/current_stage/`

2. **Technical Planning**
   - Use BDD format for acceptance criteria
   - Create mermaid diagrams for architectural changes
   - Define API changes and breaking changes
   - Estimate effort and identify risks

3. **Development Execution**
   - Create feature branch following naming convention
   - Implement using TDD approach
   - Maintain compatibility with existing architecture
   - Update demo application to showcase changes

4. **Quality Assurance**
   - Comprehensive testing (unit + integration)
   - Code review using PR template
   - Demo application verification
   - Documentation updates

5. **Integration and Release**
   - Merge to main with squash commits
   - Update task status and close tickets

## Conclusion

This implementation plan transforms LocalRetrieve from a technically excellent but process-immature project into a professionally managed development effort. The plan leverages existing technical strengths while adding systematic processes that will scale with team growth and feature complexity.

The key insight is that LocalRetrieve's technical foundation is solid - what's needed is disciplined execution of the remaining MVP features using professional development practices. This plan provides that discipline while maintaining the project's innovative technical direction.
